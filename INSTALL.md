# Installation Instructions

At this time, `tike` can only be installed from source.

## Installation from the source code

Install the package using typical installation methods.

```
$ python setup.py install
```

or

```
$ pip install .
```

The `-e` option for `pip install` makes the installation editable; this means whenever you import `tike`, any changes that you make to the source code will be included.
